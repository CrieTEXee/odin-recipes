<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Eggs - I used large eggs; cooking times are based on this size.</li>
    <li>Vinegar - Adding vinegar when boiling eggs softens the shell which makes it easier to peel.</li>
    <li>Mirin - This is a Japanese rice wine. Substitute with water or stock with a pinch of sugar and a few drops of vinegar.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Soft Boiled Eggs:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cold eggs:</strong> Boil for 7 minutes straight from the fridge. Starting with cold eggs protects the center yolk from overcooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Room temperature eggs:</strong> Allow the eggs to come to room temperature for about 30 minutes prior to cooking. Boil for 6 minutes. The egg shell is less likely to crack due to less variance in temperature.</li>
    <li><strong>Ice Bath:</strong> Prepare in advance and immediately transfer the eggs to an ice bath to stop further cooking.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Make Marinade:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Add the ingredients for the marinade in a plastic ziplock bag and place it in a bowl for stabilization. Gently add the eggs, then push out any extra air.</li>
    <li>Twist and clip the bag closed to allow the marinade to completely cover the eggs. This allows you to make a smaller amount of marinade without any waste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut in half and place on top of a bowl of ramen noodles garnished with green onions and nori. Soy sauce eggs can be used after 1 hour and up to 3 days later. Cut in half and serve atop a hot bowl of ramen. Enjoy!</p>
